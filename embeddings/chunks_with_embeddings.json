{"chunk_id":0,"chunk_text":"More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, a disease that causes high blood sugar. Normally, your body produces insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. With diabetes, your body either can't produce enough insulin or can't properly use the insulin it does produce. This causes sugar to build up in the blood, which at high enough levels can damage nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. Here's what you need to know:\nAge, weight, race and ethnicity, and health problems can affect your risk of developing type 2 diabetes\nIf you're age 45 or older, have a family history of diabetes, or are overweight, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher. Physical inactivity, race, and certain health problems also can increase your risk. There is also a greater risk among certain races and ethnicities; for example, those of African American, Latino, Native American, and Pacific American descent. Make sure to contact your doctor or health care provider regarding screening to help. Prediabetes is a warning sign\nPrediabetes occurs when your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be type 2 diabetes.","embedding":[0.0543547198,0.0071065282,-0.016565999,0.0789431259,0.0053224345,0.0102000879,0.0875829458,0.0264835041,-0.0330654308,0.0255596843,-0.0999301001,0.011960567,-0.0939964652,-0.065876849,-0.0272310618,-0.0099450918,-0.0007600912,-0.0591230802,-0.049831029,0.0544375591,0.0894373357,-0.0339364707,0.0693865046,0.0517040119,-0.0403354838,-0.0619638003,0.0257008653,0.0193521064,-0.0188396666,0.030204365,-0.0343675427,-0.0089006657,-0.0398515016,0.0539835021,-0.0902489424,0.0559320264,0.01212453,0.0216464698,-0.1051145867,-0.0155710159,0.0385264158,-0.026970746,-0.0391977318,0.1120652631,0.0079380814,-0.0720262676,-0.02851725,0.0022337404,-0.0205459017,0.0059208032,-0.0506026298,-0.0248636305,0.139636308,-0.085837841,0.0998759717,-0.0194614623,-0.0845572874,0.0022817205,0.0034473818,-0.0654222965,-0.0784393027,-0.0183328167,-0.0027856969,-0.0459209643,0.0527376235,0.0011983081,0.0045854207,-0.0131614264,0.025674222,-0.0201213416,-0.023695102,-0.060027197,-0.0435940772,0.0578066893,0.0747859627,0.0253357328,-0.0363018215,0.0114047751,-0.0427180305,-0.0088145025,0.0626829714,0.0167328734,0.120973818,0.0399282873,-0.0276306644,-0.0077877026,0.061700169,-0.0025336368,-0.0728350431,0.0168889146,-0.0137551613,-0.0417841822,0.0255024582,0.0983903185,0.0062920805,0.0140013667,-0.0225434545,-0.1268340051,0.0155360121,0.0132569913,0.0067981416,-0.0415196866,0.058075618,0.1108377054,0.0060947668,0.0144919688,-0.0309227481,-0.0130009633,0.0194083024,0.0783958808,0.1031780019,0.0678151324,0.0158363692,0.0413100608,-0.109521389,0.0291030928,-0.0262136422,-0.0586907268,0.0087435134,0.0037275588,-0.0440521017,-0.0289626084,0.0433949754,-0.0419828929,-0.0068333652,0.0260464288,-0.0100551555,5.295175934e-34,0.0507668965,-0.0328414626,0.011039936,0.026833389,0.000880628,0.0145498579,-0.0226923265,0.0694926456,-0.017575698,0.0287746247,0.0178535562,-0.0751794353,-0.040743228,0.0518670455,-0.0191562846,0.0525202751,0.0383141637,-0.0778360367,0.0454332493,0.0682607144,-0.1020316258,-0.0619488657,0.0084059043,0.0154821342,-0.0570783131,0.0170710888,-0.0234021842,0.0278133415,0.0269805286,0.0030955926,-0.0043448475,-0.0299885701,0.0787225664,-0.0911578909,0.0187006239,-0.0367352851,0.0083296532,0.0443865024,-0.0206994042,0.0128753781,0.044700969,-0.0136493435,0.0421807095,-0.0136188669,0.1385173351,-0.0110763609,0.0101901833,-0.0484079495,-0.1078249812,0.0257649664,-0.0764197707,0.0211065169,0.0428847671,0.150629133,0.0283512343,-0.0249696076,-0.016873654,-0.0305269156,0.0113505917,0.0237392541,-0.0768721253,0.0330397077,-0.0163978934,0.0093991067,-0.0464027077,-0.0442473106,-0.0019141443,0.0010730886,-0.073832728,0.0124363629,0.057359755,-0.1077183262,0.0125504881,0.0558842719,-0.0016969361,0.0873564854,-0.0124889007,-0.0249772333,0.0628750175,-0.0787616894,-0.0480929166,-0.0019553928,0.0745683834,-0.0049444875,-0.0234308783,0.0520538315,-0.0188232791,-0.0314103626,-0.0144750085,-0.0418385491,-0.0472653136,0.0721532106,-0.0287380572,0.0360815041,-0.0086119128,-3.258600747e-33,-0.0439013019,-0.0137891434,0.0187249035,-0.161685124,0.0206444375,-0.0489795022,0.0407353714,-0.1212935299,0.0350534506,-0.0547095947,0.0301339999,0.0555270389,0.0975114182,0.0028537076,0.0178750679,0.0096823387,-0.0847516507,0.1181617603,0.0005362433,-0.0581932589,-0.022170566,0.0557689629,-0.0223225132,-0.007243285,-0.0189196225,-0.0079877041,-0.0050657527,0.0115500251,-0.0004519506,0.0129998615,0.0096986052,0.0601252578,0.0356124565,-0.0050774184,0.0010854428,-0.065249458,-0.0211564619,-0.0487240963,-0.0296305083,-0.0040589627,-0.0034212132,0.0706134737,0.042981904,-0.1184990406,0.0494462214,0.0043092906,0.0464846194,0.0554980002,0.0048689488,0.0341122709,-0.0237979908,-0.0083395336,0.0008732714,0.0962893143,-0.033910498,-0.0273040477,0.0175486226,-0.0521740951,0.0165240131,0.0740609095,0.0112409992,-0.0446055047,0.0200726986,0.0015320249,0.0296511799,-0.0666232333,0.0215582699,0.0273963083,0.1058845744,0.0816090554,-0.0524030291,-0.0713656023,-0.1117651537,-0.0248278379,-0.0161698237,-0.0488468036,-0.080645375,0.134250924,0.0469723158,-0.0206662137,-0.0164394677,0.0496297069,0.0001751833,-0.0155074885,-0.0758635998,-0.0139867561,-0.0043919184,0.0004899595,0.0240956247,0.0237166397,-0.076246582,0.0796584412,-0.1187676415,-0.0376266651,-0.07254114,-0.0000000504,0.0438533165,-0.0256785564,-0.0021130617,0.0329814926,-0.0151402801,-0.0308211241,-0.0612794086,0.1028026566,0.0370869935,-0.0250229444,-0.073409982,0.0920070931,0.042554643,-0.0939431638,-0.0005064516,0.0020604124,-0.0182647556,0.0637563094,-0.0440456197,-0.0094881812,-0.0348908976,-0.0480892509,0.0168753136,0.0459909327,-0.0725155175,-0.0778252408,0.0238024648,-0.0316371135,-0.0504598953,0.0009220488,0.0040659863,0.0164803807,0.0842623934,0.0656242073,-0.0333391055,-0.0499186292,-0.0051331748,-0.0131616285,0.0238626823,-0.0466067754,0.0094374474,-0.0194832217,-0.0073441649,0.0294005107,-0.0605169125,-0.0196435619,0.0368871838,0.0305807553,0.0365090817,0.0259009022,-0.0507996194,0.0

{"chunk_id":3,"chunk_text":"However, women with gestational diabetes have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Type 2 diabetes,\nthe most common type, is linked to lifestyle factors, such as being overweight or inactive. It's also linked to genetics. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin and fails to use it efficiently. When this happens, sugar builds up in the blood.

{"chunk_id":4,"chunk_text":"En los Estados Unidos, m\u00e1s de 30 millones de personas tienen diabetes, una enfermedad que aumenta los niveles de az\u00facar en la sangre. Normalmente, el cuerpo produce insulina, una hormona que regula los niveles de az\u00facar en la sangre. Cuando se tiene diabetes, el cuerpo no produce suficiente insulina o no puede utilizar bien la insulina que produce. Esto hace que se acumule az\u00facar en la sangre. Cuando los niveles de az\u00facar est\u00e1n demasiado altos, pueden causar da\u00f1o a los nervios, los ojos, los ri\u00f1ones y otros \u00f3rganos. Esto es lo que usted debe saber:\nLa edad, el peso, la raza, el grupo \u00e9tnico y los problemas de salud pueden influir en su riesgo de tener diabetes tipo 2\nSi usted tiene 45 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s y tiene antecedentes familiares de diabetes o sobrepeso, su riesgo de tener diabetes tipo 2 es mayor. El sedentarismo, la raza y ciertos problemas de salud tambi\u00e9n aumentan el riesgo.

{"chunk_id":9,"chunk_text":"M\u00e1s de 37 millones de estadounidenses tienen\ndiabetes\n, que causa altas concentraciones de az\u00facar en la sangre. Normalmente, el cuerpo produce insulina, una hormona que ayuda a regular los niveles de glucosa en la sangre, tambi\u00e9n llamada az\u00facar en la sangre. Con diabetes, el cuerpo no puede producir suficiente insulina o no puede usar debidamente la insulina que produce. En las personas con\ndiabetes tipo 1\n, el sistema inmunitario destruye las c\u00e9lulas productoras de insulina en el p\u00e1ncreas. Esto causa acumulaci\u00f3n de az\u00facar en la sangre. Con el tiempo, el alto nivel de az\u00facar en la sangre puede causar da\u00f1o en los nervios, el coraz\u00f3n, los ojos, los ri\u00f1ones, las enc\u00edas y los dientes y otros \u00f3rganos.

pregnancy.","embedding":[0.0209786464,-0.0041201566,-0.0835278779,0.0651997253,0.0506524928,0.0063802986,0.0883546621,-0.0065361606,0.0262525696,0.0588397235,-0.0801609308,0.0197058637,-0.092508927,0.0148882912,-0.0238861516,0.0335813612,-0.0009166144,-0.0927697644,0.0509175137,0.0671517104,0.0788175538,-0.0456938706,0.0530481189,-0.0141440099,-0.0016990117,-0.0565455928,0.0982077718,0.0418229997,-0.015328181,0.039256487,-0.0721987337,0.0033460672,-0.0549523309,0.0720116496,-0.0772761554,0.0804495513,0.0031531767,0.0213699155,-0.0532194301,-0.0440727733,0.0566905215,0.0142973587,-0.0086238319,0.1023779362,0.0194362048,-0.0167696979,-0.0688978657,-0.000511278,-0.0634721518,0.0007452711,0.0094281221,-0.067880109,0.1187609062,-0.0431092083,0.0231811572,-0.0620459206,-0.0757531375,-0.0534144342,0.0625635386,-0.1107755154,-0.1119019538,-0.0158949196,0.0233475342,-0.0350797847,0.0347806029,0.0949282572,0.0457728915,0.0494111367,-0.0039497213,-0.0507987477,-0.0334453285,0.0834050626,-0.0250862949,0.0442339964,-0.0080517149,0.097019352,0.0175088756,0.0819406956,-0.0434653163,-0.0391910784,0.048376523,0.1199436411,0.076289244,-0.0038447652,-0.0251182932,0.0552576371,0.0921059176,0.001308358,-0.0537928008,-0.0572753958,-0.0131789651,0.0058024968,-0.0434334502,-0.0535351411,-0.0163636282,-0.0081129177,-0.0122533655,-0.1351157874,0.0706104711,0.0099735437,0.029459171,-0.0219894741,0.0796188042,0.1370422393,0.0272105373,0.0696875229,-0.1144501269,0.0324791819,-0.0872889757,0.0184846483,-0.0550747365,0.0499516167,0.0767242163,0.0041279113,-0.0464779921,0.0405166298,-0.0666029453,0.0133768115,0.059094891,0.0375455022,-0.0278963856,0.0221519172,-0.0024947547,-0.06264662,0.0193087738,0.066268228,-0.0384607539,4.173636406e-33,0.0305257216,-0.0961233899,0.0294031706,-0.017014889,-0.0231032576,0.0674502701,0.0545326807,0.0281756911,0.029195521,-0.0010172988,-0.0377756208,-0.0587663054,-0.0068437392,-0.0359916985,-0.0052165743,0.0893006846,0.0392931476,-0.0576004684,-0.0009223793,0.0510229804,-0.0250061378,-0.0339498781,0.055808872,-0.0792320296,-0.0218213983,-0.037605647,-0.0027975263,-0.0156266298,-0.029348284,0.0143277133,-0.0321095102,0.025276076,0.0393155478,-0.0484006256,-0.0027566343,-0.055233378,0.0415519923,0.0216755047,0.0716850162,-0.0205693375,0.0007726428,-0.049475003,0.0402851105,-0.1058709174,0.0570751801,-0.0140095884,-0.0016106267,-0.0609968454,-0.0300981775,0.0119285695,-0.020211352,-0.0139434738,-0.0303317364,0.0684841573,0.0374703258,-0.0523346327,-0.0307328328,-0.0881226137,0.0324075185,-0.0284876376,-0.0234432071,0.0028359469,-0.0401652902,-0.0758589208,-0.0778728202,-0.085605219,-0.0254159924,0.0171737671,-0.0187107753,-0.066649206,0.0993686244,-0.0828756094,-0.0106298132,0.0001619505,-0.0117362048,0.0565760992,0.0086239465,-0.0371006019,0.0000990159,-0.0210983884,-0.029810017,0.0573087744,0.0933710337,-0.0124653867,-0.0213861521,-0.0031964486,0.0326732174,0.0340789557,-0.0430782102,-0.0649213791,-0.057062272,0.0674849376,-0.0375087634,0.0295490455,0.0314743333,-5.610511844e-33,0.007067394,0.0759918764,0.0226348042,-0.0875246078,-0.0197642948,-0.0774223804,0.0281326156,-0.1015127301,-0.0344708599,-0.0180454757,0.0368387029,0.0020527614,0.038172625,0.0013391714,0.0441547036,0.0565752424,-0.1008107662,0.06220318,0.068253234,-0.0144981826,-0.0154629871,-0.0459828973,-0.0521996655,-0.0511403754,0.0799450204,-0.0152915614,0.074044168,0.0670345053,-0.0565177873,0.0169747081,-0.0677343979,0.0395359322,0.0454613566,0.0136307376,0.0935238376,-0.0968908966,-0.0763197988,-0.0016164809,0.0389770791,-0.0551082864,-0.0620956458,0.041643776,0.0296223126,-0.062059965,0.0385910533,-0.0247970372,0.0651081577,0.0301895328,0.0904985219,0.0689878613,-0.0272754095,0.0054032942,-0.0605262518,0.0247790534,-0.0817231461,0.0170060005,0.06028625,-0.026297057,-0.0080295317,0.0323781259,0.0009000669,-0.0023622704,0.0059032193,-0.029716406,-0.0092099402,-0.0137697384,0.0937716216,0.0180243645,0.093934305,0.0551682375,-0.0716427267,0.0309243482,-0.071377337,-0.0272826608,0.0444914326,-0.0716343448,-0.0426722243,0.0633156598,0.0187118798,-0.0292067192,-0.0107556116,0.0249108989,0.0014766577,-0.0368912928,-0.0500044115,-0.0561878383,-0.0099651366,-0.0681098998,0.0761266798,-0.0386167243,-0.0348915532,0.0731442496,-0.1078588441,-0.0692561492,0.0515170135,-0.0000000472,0.0709779635,-0.0197370052,-0.042947989,0.0582004301,0.0112120677,-0.0490500815,0.0232320856,0.0201690812,0.0271072928,-0.1077352911,-0.0237895474,0.0765598267,-0.0209225174,-0.0417383611,0.031052541,0.0054286071,-0.0348114111,0.0980639085,-0.0357239991,-0.0187999029,-0.0098510217,-0.0271757711,0.0376962349,0.0539844818,-0.0705904737,-0.0511568747,-0.0258311592,-0.0480594225,0.0166437533,0.0149264252,0.0392996334,0.0375800692,0.0330812037,-0.0170727856,0.0326638333,0.0285110604,-0.0557892397,0.0236758534,-0.005391167,-0.0297831688,-0.0164788067,-0.0030743531,0.0092823366,-0.0328600556,-0.0101886382,-0.0670370311,0.0317854434,-0.0217435025,0.0519186817,0.0048742048,-0.0201923

If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours. How can diabetes affect my pregnancy? Having diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:\nYou are more likely to develop\npreeclampsia\n, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure. You are more likely to need a\ncesarean delivery\n, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.

You are more likely to need a\ncesarean delivery\n, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average. Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your\nmeal plan\n, physical activity routine, and\/or\nmedicines\n.

Diabetes\n, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease that affects how your body uses glucose (\nblood sugar\n). Glucose is your body's main source of energy. A\nhormone\n\u00c2\u00a0(a chemical messenger in your bloodstream that controls the actions of certain cells or organs) called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get\ntoo high\n, which can lead to serious\nhealth conditions\n. These may include\nheart disease\n,\nnerve damage\n,\neye problems\n, and\nkidney disease\n.

{"chunk_id":106,"chunk_text":"This is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than what is healthy for you but not high enough to be considered diabetes. But having prediabetes raises your risk of getting type 2 diabetes later on. Why do I need a diabetes test? You may need testing to monitor your blood glucose level or if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as:\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nIncreased hunger\nFatigue\nBlurred vision\nUnexplained weight loss\nSores that are slow to heal\nNumbness or tingling in your feet\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes often develop slowly, even over years. Gestational diabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms in the early stages of your pregnancy, but you will most likely be screened for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.

{"chunk_id":111,"chunk_text":"This test may be used if you have symptoms of diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)\n. This test measures the average amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin over the past three months. Hemoglobin is the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. No fasting is required for this test. Glucose may also be measured in your urine. Urine tests are not often used to diagnose or monitor diabetes since blood tests are more accurate. But a urine test may show if you are at risk for getting the disease. If your glucose in urine levels are too high, then you will probably need a blood test to confirm the diagnosis. For a\nglucose in urine\n\u00c2\u00a0test\n, your provider may recommend an\nat-home\n\u00c2\u00a0test kit. The kit will include a test strip that you hold under your stream of urine.

{"chunk_id":115,"chunk_text":"Most of the time, gestational diabetes goes away after giving birth. But you will be at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future. If you have other questions about your diabetes diagnosis or treatment, talk to your provider. Learn more about\nlaboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results\n. Is there anything else I need to know about diabetes testing? If you've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you will need to monitor your blood glucose levels daily, often several times a day. Your provider can recommend a kit you can use at home. Most kits include a lancet, a device that pricks your finger. You will use this to collect a drop of blood for testing. There are some newer kits available that don't require pricking your finger. If you are pregnant and have gestational diabetes, you may also need to monitor your glucose levels in this way.

La diabetes, tambi\u00c3\u00a9n conocida como diabetes mellitus, es una enfermedad en la que los niveles de\nglucosa\n(o az\u00c3\u00bacar) en sangre son demasiado altos. La glucosa es la principal fuente de energ\u00c3\u00ada del cuerpo. Su cuerpo puede producir glucosa, pero tambi\u00c3\u00a9n proviene de los alimentos que consume. La insulina es una\nhormona\nproducida por el p\u00c3\u00a1ncreas. La insulina ayuda a trasladar la glucosa del torrente sangu\u00c3\u00adneo a las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas, donde se puede usar como energ\u00c3\u00ada. Si tiene diabetes, su cuerpo no puede producir insulina, no puede usarla como deber\u00c3\u00ada; o ambas cosas a la vez. Demasiada glucosa permanece en la sangre y no llega a las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas.

Si usted tiene\ndiabetes\n, sus niveles de\nglucosa\no az\u00c3\u00bacar en sangre son demasiado altos. La glucosa proviene de los alimentos que come. Una\nhormona\nllamada insulina ayuda a que la glucosa ingrese a las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas para darles energ\u00c3\u00ada. En la\ndiabetes tipo 1\n, el cuerpo no produce insulina. En la\ndiabetes tipo 2\n, el cuerpo no produce o no utiliza bien la insulina. Sin suficiente insulina, la glucosa permanece en la sangre. \u00c2\u00bfQu\u00c3\u00a9 es la diabetes gestacional?

La\ndiabetes\nes una enfermedad en la que los niveles de\nglucosa (az\u00c3\u00bacar) de la sangre\nest\u00c3\u00a1n muy altos. Las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas de su cuerpo necesitan glucosa para obtener energ\u00c3\u00ada. Una hormona llamada insulina ayuda a que la glucosa entre en las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas. En la\ndiabetes tipo 1\n, el cuerpo no produce insulina. En la\ndiabetes tipo 2\n,  el cuerpo no la produce o no la usa bien. Sin suficiente insulina, la glucosa no puede ingresar a sus c\u00c3\u00a9lulas tan r\u00c3\u00a1pido como de costumbre. La glucosa se acumula y causa niveles altos de az\u00c3\u00bacar en la sangre. \u00c2\u00bfCu\u00c3\u00a1les son los tratamientos para la diabetes?

La\ndiabetes\ntipo 2 es una enfermedad en la que los niveles de\nglucosa o az\u00c3\u00bacar en la sangre\nson demasiado altos. La glucosa es su principal fuente de energ\u00c3\u00ada. Proviene de los alimentos que consume. Una hormona llamada insulina ayuda a que la glucosa ingrese a las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas para brindarles energ\u00c3\u00ada. Si tiene diabetes, su cuerpo no produce suficiente insulina o no la usa bien. Luego, la glucosa permanece en la sangre y no ingresa lo suficiente a las c\u00c3\u00a9lulas.
